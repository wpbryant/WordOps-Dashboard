# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-19
**Phases:** 1-4
**Total Plans:** 12

## Overview

Build a modern web dashboard for WordOps server management, starting with authentication and backend foundation, then implementing site CRUD operations, adding server monitoring capabilities, and finally deploying with proper nginx/systemd configuration.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation

**Goal**: Set up project structure with working authentication and backend API skeleton
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Project scaffolding and backend setup
- [x] 01-02: JWT authentication system
- [x] 01-03: WordOps CLI wrapper module

**Key deliverables:**
- FastAPI application skeleton with health endpoints
- Pydantic-settings configuration with WO_DASHBOARD_ env prefix
- JWT authentication with login endpoint and protected routes
- WordOps CLI wrapper with safe async subprocess execution
- Domain validation to prevent command injection

### Phase 2: Site Management

**Goal**: Full site CRUD API for WordOps sites with filtering, search, and validation
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Sites API router with list endpoint and filtering
- [x] 02-02: Site detail endpoint for single site info
- [x] 02-03: Create site CLI wrapper and POST endpoint
- [x] 02-04: Update and delete site operations

**Key deliverables:**
- GET /api/v1/sites with type, ssl, search filtering
- GET /api/v1/sites/{domain} for site details
- POST /api/v1/sites for site creation (WordPress, PHP, HTML, Proxy)
- PUT /api/v1/sites/{domain} for SSL, cache, PHP updates
- DELETE /api/v1/sites/{domain} with confirmation requirement

### Phase 3: Server Dashboard

**Goal**: Server monitoring with Netdata metrics and log viewing
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: Netdata metrics integration (CPU, RAM, disk, network via API proxy)
- [x] 03-02: Service status display (systemctl wrapper with restart capability)
- [x] 03-03: Real-time log viewer with WebSocket streaming

**Key deliverables:**
- GET /api/v1/server/metrics proxying Netdata API v3
- GET /api/v1/server/services with 11 service allowlist
- POST /api/v1/server/services/{name}/restart
- WebSocket /api/v1/server/logs/{type}/ws with hardcoded path security

### Phase 4: Deployment

**Goal**: Production-ready deployment with nginx and systemd
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: Deployment config files (nginx template, systemd unit, env config)
- [x] 04-02: Installation script with WordOps integration

**Key deliverables:**
- Nginx reverse proxy with WebSocket support and rate limiting
- Systemd service with unix socket and restart policy
- Environment config template
- 746-line bash installer with install/upgrade/uninstall support

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Python/FastAPI for better subprocess handling
- pydantic-settings with WO_DASHBOARD_ env prefix
- asyncio.create_subprocess_exec for safe CLI execution
- OAuth2PasswordRequestForm for Swagger UI compatibility
- Hardcoded log paths for security
- WebSocket auth via query param
- Unix socket for uvicorn/nginx communication

**Issues Resolved:**
- python-multipart dependency added to pyproject.toml
- Dependency sync between requirements.txt and pyproject.toml

**Technical Debt:**
- Missing 01-VERIFICATION.md (Phase 1 summaries exist but no formal verification)
- Frontend not included (backend-first approach)
